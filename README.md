# Ecore2GmModel Prototype
The Ecore2GmModel Prototype is a model transformation implemented in [Eclipse Epsilon](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/).
The transformation generates data models for the Tribefire platform. The generated moels conforms to the meta-model of Tribefire. The meta-model can be accessed via the Base Models menu entry in a running Tribefire platform.

The generated Java APIs can be used during the Modeling and Implementation activities. They can be used to create [Model Primings assets](https://documentation.tribefire.com/tribefire.cortex.documentation/concepts-doc/features/platform_assets.html?searchText=ModelPrimings).
