/*
Auto-generated code via model transformation (Eclipse Epsilon EGL/EGX).
Task: Cartridge Development - Data Model generation
This Java source artifact defines the Data Type SubscriptionChannel of the Data Model fhir.
The resulting Data Model 
- has to be imported as servlet in your TribeFire server (Data Model are bundled within a .war file), 
- has to be detected and syncronized in the TribeFire::ControlCenter
As a result, a Business Model (or simply Model) should be visible throung the TribeFire:Modeler.

@Description("The subscription resource is used to define a push-based subscription from a server to another system. Once a subscription is registered with the server, the server checks every resource that is created or updated, and if the resource matches the given criteria, it sends a message on the defined 'channel' so that another system can take an appropriate action.")
