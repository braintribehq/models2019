/*
Auto-generated code via model transformation (Eclipse Epsilon EGL/EGX).
Task: Cartridge Development - Data Model generation
This Java source artifact defines the Data Type ImplementationGuideGrouping of the Data Model fhir.
The resulting Data Model 
- has to be imported as servlet in your TribeFire server (Data Model are bundled within a .war file), 
- has to be detected and syncronized in the TribeFire::ControlCenter
As a result, a Business Model (or simply Model) should be visible throung the TribeFire:Modeler.
